# Software Tools and Techniques for AI  

This repository contains projects and implementations from the course **Software Tools and Techniques for AI**, focusing on best practices in AI development, model optimization, and deployment strategies.  

## Projects  
1. [**Annotation System**](https://github.com/Aryan-IIT/annotation_cs203) – Built an annotation platform to streamline dataset labeling.  
2. [**AI Information Portal**](https://github.com/Aryan-IIT/information_portal_cs203) – Developed a web-based information hub for AI-related resources.  
3. [**Data Validation**](datavalidation_cs203.ipynb) – Utilised great expectations and pandora to validate data.  

## Overview  
Throughout this course, I have explored various techniques and tools to enhance AI workflows, covering topics such as (upcoming projects):  

- **Active Learning & Cost-Effective Labeling** – Implemented active learning loops to optimize annotation costs.  
- **Data Augmentation** – Applied transformations using Albumentations and Augly to enhance dataset diversity.  
- **Reproducibility & Experiment Tracking** – Set up MLflow and Weights & Biases for tracking experiments and dataset versioning using DVC.  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization** – Compared manual tuning vs. automated search using AutoGluon and Weights & Biases sweeps.  
- **Model Checkpointing & Visualization** – Integrated checkpointing in PyTorch training loops and visualized metrics with TensorBoard.  
- **Self-Contained Environments** – Containerized AI applications using Docker for reproducibility and deployment on cloud platforms (GCP/AWS).  
- **Profiling & Optimization** – Analyzed model runtime with PyTorch Profiler and implemented optimizations such as pruning and mixed precision.  
- **CI/CD in AI Pipelines** – Automated model training and deployment with GitHub Actions and Jenkins.  
- **A/B Testing & Covariate Shift Handling** – Evaluated model performance using A/B testing strategies and Alibi Detect for distribution shifts.  
- **Edge Deployment** – Converted and optimized models for deployment on constrained devices using TensorFlow Lite and ONNX.
